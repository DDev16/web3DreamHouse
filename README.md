<h1>Web3realty: Web3Realty</h1>

<p>Web3realty: Web3Realty is a decentralized application (DApp) built on React and Next.js. This innovative DApp integrates blockchain technology to revolutionize the real estate industry.</p>

<p>This project utilizes Web3.js to interact directly with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling features such as property listing, property buying, and selling transactions to be managed in a decentralized manner. This not only provides a secure, transparent and efficient process for real estate transactions, but also eliminates the need for intermediaries, thereby reducing transaction costs.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Property Listing:</strong> Users can list their properties on the platform, setting details such as price, location, and description. These details are then stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.</li>
  <li><strong>Property Buying/Selling:</strong> Buyers can browse listed properties and make a purchase directly through the platform. Transactions are handled via Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring security, speed and simplicity.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> The platform is entirely decentralized. All transactions and data storage are handled on-chain, reducing reliance on intermediaries and increasing transparency.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web3realty: Web3Realty represents the future of real estate, combining the power of blockchain with the usability of modern web development to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Make sure to have <code>node.js</code> and <code>yarn</code> installed in your system. Clone this repository and install the dependencies using <code>yarn install</code>.</p>

<h2>Running the Application</h2>

<p>Start a local Hardhat node using the command <code>yarn hardhat node</code>.</p>

<p>Deploy the <code>Registration.sol</code> contract using the appropriate hardhat command. Ensure to replace the placeholder with the actual command: <code>yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost</code></p>

<p>Once the contract is deployed, note down the contract's address and update it in the necessary places in your code or configuration files.</p>

<p>To start the development server, use the command <code>yarn dev</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure to have a local Ethereum node running or use a service like Infura. Update the <code>.env</code> file with the necessary variables such as the <code>REACT_APP_INFURA_ID</code> and your deployed contract address.</p>
